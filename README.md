1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* let
	    A let statement is a variable that is only seen inside the block its been decleared in.
	* const
	    A const statement is a statement that cannot be changed from the block its been decleared in. So if you try to change the statement JavaScript will throw an error.
	* ES6 Classes
	    Class is like a defining a concept of an object in the real world. If we have a dog what properites does the dog have that makes it a dog? Then we can take those properties and make it unqiue for an individual dog.
	* import/export
	    Import is a way of getting functions or objects from scripts saved on different parts of the computer. Export is a way of allows other js files to grab the functions or objects that we want to export.
	* JSX
        JSX is a way to make javascript more readable for people to use
	* this.props
	    this is a way of refering to the owner of the function we are executing. props stands for properties which is values or objects that is passed to a componet. So this.props will refer to the owner of the function that passed a props argument.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called Profile. `create-react-app profile`
	* Navigate into /profile and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<NavBar />` and a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Body.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Body />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Body />` will display some information about yourself.
	* Try adding an image, some text, and some links to your github profile.
	* For the content in `<Body />` try to break things down into their own components as much as you can.  The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating basic components.  You should be very comfortable with the basic syntax of creating React components before the next lesson.
